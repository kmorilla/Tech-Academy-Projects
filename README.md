# Tech-Academy-Projects
Here you will find a few projects I worked on during my time in The Tech Academy bootcamp. Most of them are quick small projects where I was just writing code to get the idea of the language. Below are the main projects.

## C# Course
### TwentyOne
This project is a console game of Twenty One for one user. The game begins by asking you for your name and how much money you are wanting to play with. It then shuffles the cards, deals them, and asks you to bid. The game will continue until you either leave with your earnings or you run out of money.

### CarInsurance
This is car insurance website using ASP.NET MVC and BootStrap 4 that asks you for personal and vehicle information and then calculates a quote based on what you have entered. This information is stored into a SQL Server Database using Entity Framework Code First. That quote can then be viewed through an admin page. I chose to do this project because I really like the use of Entity Framework and I wanted to get more in depth with it. 

## HTML & CSS Course
### Space Station
This was my first main project in the course and the purpose of it was to create a space station website using only HTML and CSS, which were the only two languages I knew a the time. 

## JavaScript Course
### Pizza Drill
The purpose of this project was to create a pizza website that used JavaScript to calculate a pizza being ordered and display it on the screen with its price. This project really helped me understand how much JavaScript can help to make a website more dynamic and to understand the functions. 

## SQL dB Library
This folder contains the project of creating a database that has different books, authors and libraries and kept track of which and how many books were in each libray. This project really shows the use of foreign keys and the concept of relational databases.
